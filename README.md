# InfiniteYou-FLUX

Generate images that preserve your identity while applying any style or context you describe.

[![Replicate](https://replicate.com/infiniteyou-flux/badge)](https://replicate.com/infiniteyou-flux)

## What is InfiniteYou?

InfiniteYou is a model that takes a portrait image of you and creates a new image that:
- Keeps your facial identity
- Applies the style, setting, and context from your text prompt
- Maintains high image quality

Unlike other models, it doesn't just copy-paste your face - it rebuilds the entire image while preserving your likeness.

## How to Use

### API Example

```python
import replicate

output = replicate.run(
    "infiniteyou-flux",
    input={
        "id_image": "https://example.com/your-photo.jpg",
        "prompt": "A portrait of a person in a sci-fi setting, cyberpunk style, neon lights",
        "model_version": "aes_stage2"
    }
)

print(output)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| id_image | Upload a portrait image containing a human face | Required |
| prompt | Describe how you want the generated image to look | "Portrait, 4K, high quality, cinematic" |
| control_image | Optional second image to control the pose/position | None |
| model_version | Choose "aes_stage2" for better aesthetics or "sim_stage1" for higher identity similarity | "aes_stage2" |
| width | Output image width in pixels | 864 |
| height | Output image height in pixels | 1152 |
| num_steps | Number of diffusion steps (higher = better quality but slower) | 30 |
| guidance_scale | How closely to follow the prompt | 3.5 |
| seed | Random seed for reproducible results (0 for random) | 0 |
| enable_realism | Apply the realism enhancement | false |
| enable_anti_blur | Reduce blurriness in results | false |

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Clear Face Input**: Use a portrait where the face is clearly visible
2. **Detailed Prompts**: Be specific about style, setting, lighting, etc.
3. **Choose the Right Model**:
   - Use `aes_stage2` for better text-image alignment and aesthetics
   - Use `sim_stage1` for stronger identity preservation

## Examples

### Professional Portrait
```
Input: Your headshot
Prompt: "A professional portrait photograph, wearing a business suit, neutral background, studio lighting, 4K, sharp"
```

### Fantasy Character
```
Input: Your selfie
Prompt: "A fantasy character portrait, mythical setting, magical forest background, glowing aura, detailed fantasy clothing"
```
